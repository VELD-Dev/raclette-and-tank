## How to use ?
### Step 1
Go to `USRDIR > packed > levels > LEVEL_NAME`, use PSArcTool or PS3GameExtractor and extract:
1. `level_cached.psarc` for the models and everything
2. `level_uncached.psarc` for the scripts *(not necessary but can help fangame developers)*

### Step 2
Open Blender.  
Click `Edit` in the topbar, then `‚öô Preferences`.
Go to `Add-ons` category, and search for `Raclette and Tank Importer` (it is in `Reverse-Engineering` category)  
Click the check mark to enable the plugin.

### Step 3
Click `File` in the topbar, then `üì• Import`.  
  
![Click file](.gitresources/open_files.png)  
  
![Click Import](.gitresources/click_import.png)  
  
Press `Extract & Import RAC Assets (level folder)`.  
  
![Select E&IRACALF](.gitresources/click_extract_rac_level.png)  
  

### Step 4
In the browser, search for your folder `USRDIR > packed > levels > LEVEL_NAME > built > levels > LEVEL_NAME` (depending on which game you want to export models)  
  
![Browse LEVEL](.gitresources/find_level_folder.png)  
  
Check or uncheck options depending what you want to export and have on Blender. You can always import previously non-imported elements to the scene by redoing the [Step 3](#user-content-step-3). Do not forget to uncheck what you already imported to avoid duplicates.

[^1]: It's basically the greatest part of the terrain and walkable parts of maps.

[^2]: All the entities, so bolts, enemies, destructibles, crates, moving platforms, etc...

[^3]: All the map's mini-elements: Little stuff on walls, etc... Generally decorations

[^4]: If a part of the terrain is not a Tie, then it's UFrags. If unchecked, some maps may look very bad and incomplete

[^5]: It's used to group parts of the terrain and mobys in subfolders in Blender, iirc

[^6]: It seems obvious... But it's the textures. Of everything.
